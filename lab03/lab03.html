	<h3>Comparison</h3>
	<p>For part A, it was easier to implement in the sense that I control all the
		styling and everything so I know first-hand what is the problem if I ever ran into 
		any issues. Although, I found it easier, it was quite time-consuming to edit everything 
		so that it works for different breakpoints and that it works the way I wanted it to. 
		As for part B, I definitely took less time working on it but I found it harder as it is a 
		new thing for me.
		<br>
		Overall, with more time and effort into learning about Bootstrap, I think I would enjoy using it 
		more than pure CSS media queries and viewport as it gives a lot of options for the user to customize their webpage. 
		I have never used bootstrap before, so figuring out issues with my HTML markup. 
		The problems I came across while using Bootstrap affects my opinion a lot. For example, I had issues with the height 
		of the columns when it switches between certain breakpoints, which I hopefully fixed. 
		Additionally, it resized my pictures differently in Part B than in Part A so that was something 
		I needed to fix in Bootstrap that also took me quite a bit to resolve.</p>
